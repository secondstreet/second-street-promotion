# Contributing
When making a contribution, be sure to bump the versions in:
  - `readme.txt`
  - `.github/workflows/main.yml`
  - `secondstreet-promotion.php`

  _**After**_ a merge to master is made, a release for the contribution will need to be cut. We use Semantic Versioning for our releases. Use a different name for every Major Version (our naming scheme is environmentally-friendly technologies).
