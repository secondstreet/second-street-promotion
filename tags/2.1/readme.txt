Embed your Second Street Promotion on a WordPress page using the Shortcode generated in the Second Street Partner Tool.


== Description ==

The Second Street Promotion Plugin will allow you to embed your Second Street Promotion within your WordPress site. The feature to generate the Shortcode required for this plugin is located within your promotion's [Second Street Partner Tool](https://affiliates.upickem.net). After retrieving your Promotion's Shortcode, you will paste it into the page content area of the WordPress page you would like it to appear on.

NOTE: The embedded Promotion's width will be dependent on the size of the parent container/element that it is placed in. If your promotion appears too narrow or too wide, try adjusting the width of its container.


== Installation ==

1. Extract files from the ZIP file.
2. Upload `secondstreet-promotion` folder (contains `secondstreet-promotion.php`) 
   to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Retrieve (copy) your Promotion's Shortcode from your Second Street Partner Tool. 
   (Login to your Second Street account at https://affiliates.upickem.net) 
5. Place (paste) your Shortcode into the page content area in your WordPress site.
